# IoT-Driven Sleep Apnea Detection

**Project Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress (Mid-Semester) ðŸš§

[cite_start]This is the official repository for the Capstone Project `CPG-167` from the Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology[cite: 10, 17]. [cite_start]Our project focuses on developing a non-invasive, affordable, and real-time sleep apnea detection system using a wearable IoT wristband and AI[cite: 35, 39].

[cite_start]The system aims to address the limitations of traditional Polysomnography (PSG), which is often costly, inconvenient, and inaccessible for continuous monitoring[cite: 33, 45, 566].

### ## Key Features

* [cite_start]**Multi-Sensor Data Fusion:** The wearable wristband integrates multiple biosensors to capture physiological signals, including **SpOâ‚‚**, **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**, and **ECG**[cite: 461, 610].
* [cite_start]**AI-Powered Detection:** An AI/ML model analyzes the collected data in real-time to identify apnea events and assess their severity[cite: 37, 653].
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Alerts:** The system features a dual-alert mechanism, including a local buzzer on the device and notifications to a mobile app for users or caregivers[cite: 465, 616].
* [cite_start]**Cloud Integration:** Data is wirelessly transmitted via an ESP32 microcontroller to a cloud platform (Firebase) for storage, advanced analysis, and remote monitoring by healthcare providers[cite: 38, 1139].

### ## Project Status & Next Steps

[cite_start]We have successfully completed the hardware assembly and data acquisition pipeline[cite: 1301]. [cite_start]The wearable prototype can currently capture physiological signals (ECG, SpOâ‚‚) and transmit them successfully to our Firebase database in real-time[cite: 1302].

[cite_start]**Our immediate next step is to integrate the AI model with the Firebase data to perform apnea detection**[cite: 1303, 1305].
