# IoT-Driven Sleep Apnea Detection

**Project Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress (Mid-Semester) ðŸš§

This is the official repository for the Capstone Project `CPG-167` from the Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. Our project focuses on developing a non-invasive, affordable, and real-time sleep apnea detection system using a wearable IoT wristband and AI.

The system aims to address the limitations of traditional Polysomnography (PSG), which is often costly, inconvenient, and inaccessible for continuous monitoring.

### ## Key Features

* **Multi-Sensor Data Fusion:** The wearable wristband integrates multiple biosensors to capture physiological signals, including **SpOâ‚‚**, **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**, and **ECG**.
* **AI-Powered Detection:** An AI/ML model analyzes the collected data in real-time to identify apnea events and assess their severity.
* **Real-Time Alerts:** The system features a dual-alert mechanism, including a local buzzer on the device and notifications to a mobile app for users or caregivers.
* **Cloud Integration:** Data is wirelessly transmitted via an ESP32 microcontroller to a cloud platform (Firebase) for storage, advanced analysis, and remote monitoring by healthcare providers.

### ## Technology Stack

| Component | Technologies & Tools |
|---|---|
| **Hardware** | ESP32 Microcontroller, MAX30102 (SpOâ‚‚/HR Sensor), MAX30003 (ECG Sensor). |
| **Firmware** | Arduino IDE / PlatformIO, C++. |
| **AI / Machine Learning** | Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas. |
| **Cloud & Backend** | Google Firebase (Realtime Database). |
| **Frontend** | Mobile App (React Native/Flutter planned), Web Dashboard (Streamlit/React planned). |

### ## Project Status & Next Steps

We have successfully completed the hardware assembly and data acquisition pipeline. The wearable prototype can currently capture physiological signals (ECG, SpOâ‚‚) and transmit them successfully to our Firebase database in real-time.

**Our immediate next step is to integrate the AI model with the Firebase data to perform apnea detection**.
